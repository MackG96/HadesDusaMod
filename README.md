# HadesDusaMod
Test Mod for Hades that adds Dusa as a God. This isn't intended to be a well thought out or balanced mod, just a test to learn how Hades works.

For now, DusaMod.txt contains all data and instructions on where to put it. Ideally, I'd like a more robust solution.

In the /Scripts folder, LootData.lua and TraitData.lua need to be edited. 

In the /Game/Obstacles folder, Gameplay.sjson needs to be edited. 

In the /Game/Projectiles folder PlayerProjectiles.sjson needs to be edited. 

In the /Game/Weapons folder PlayerWeapons.sjson needs to be edited.
